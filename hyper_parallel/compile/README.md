# HyperParallel Graph Mode

Graph-mode architecture for automatic parallelization with FSDP.

> **Note**: The `compile/` subpackage relies on a patched autograd engine for
> joint-graph capture (see Limitations). Its `torch.*` imports — including
> `torch.fx.experimental` and `torch._guards` — are therefore intentional and
> carry a `forbidden-backend-import` suppression in
> `.jenkins/check/config/filter_pylint.txt`.

## Core Concept

**User**: Write model code + parallel configuration
**Framework**: Graph capture → FSDP partitioning → Communication-compute overlap → Execution

## Architecture

### Layer 1: Configuration

```python
from hyper_parallel.compile import GraphParallelPlan, PassConfig

# Configure which modules to mark for FSDP
parallel_plan = GraphParallelPlan()
parallel_plan.fsdp_mark("tok_embeddings")
parallel_plan.fsdp_mark_pattern("layers.*")

# Parallel configuration
pass_config = PassConfig(enable_overlap=True)
```

### Layer 2: Graph Capture

`trace_model_graph` captures forward + backward into a joint FX graph:

- Parameters/buffers are static inputs (placeholders), not `get_attr` nodes
- `torch.autograd.grad` runs inside the traced function
- Uses `FakeTensorMode` + `make_fx` for symbolic tracing

### Layer 3: Pass Pipeline

```text
DeadCodeElimination → CanonicalizeGraph → FSDPPass → AutoOverlapPass
```

**FSDPPass**:

- Identifies FSDP parameter placeholders via GraphParallelPlan
- Sinks `all_gather` to each parameter's first forward use (Shard → Replicate)
- Frees the replicated parameter after its last forward read, then re-gathers
  it for the backward and rematerializes any saved forward view of it
  (`reshard_after_forward`), so peak memory tracks the forward working set
- Inserts `reduce_scatter` on gradient outputs (Replicate → Shard)
- Physically shards live model parameters (dim 0) so optimizer is FSDP-agnostic

Disable reshard with `PassConfig(fsdp_reshard_after_forward=False)`.

**AutoOverlapPass**:

- Reorders `wait_tensor` nodes for communication-compute overlap

### Layer 4: Execution

```python
from hyper_parallel.compile import GraphTrainer

trainer = GraphTrainer(
    model=model,
    train_fn=train_fn,
    pass_config=pass_config,
    parallel_plan=parallel_plan,
)

# Compile on first batch, then run forward + backward + optimizer
trainer.train(dataloader, max_steps=100, log_interval=10)
```

The compiled graph is a `GraphModule` that:

- Takes sharded parameters as inputs
- Gathers them via AllGather at each step
- Computes forward + backward
- Scatters gradients via ReduceScatter
- Outputs loss + grads

## Usage

```python
from hyper_parallel.compile import GraphParallelPlan, GraphTrainer, PassConfig

# 1. Model
model = Llama3Model(config)

# 2. Parallel plan
parallel_plan = GraphParallelPlan()
parallel_plan.fsdp_mark_pattern("layers.*")

# 3. Trainer
trainer = GraphTrainer(
    model=model,
    train_fn=lambda m, x, y: m(x).loss(y),
    pass_config=PassConfig(enable_overlap=True),
    parallel_plan=parallel_plan,
)

# 4. Training
trainer.train(dataloader, max_steps=1000)
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Static Inputs**: Parameters are graph inputs, not `get_attr`. This allows passes to split the graph by reshaping placeholders.

2. **Joint Graph**: Forward + backward captured together via `torch.autograd.grad` inside the traced function.

3. **FSDP-Agnostic Optimizer**: FSDPPass shards the live model's parameters in place. `model.parameters()` returns shards, so optimizer needs no FSDP awareness.

4. **Declarative Sharding**: GraphParallelPlan uses FQN patterns (`layers.*`) instead of imperative module wrapping.

## Limitations

- FSDP only (TP/EP/PP planned)
- Parameters must have dim 0 divisible by world_size
- Requires torch with patched autograd engine for joint-graph capture
